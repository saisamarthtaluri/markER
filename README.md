# markER

## Motivation
Drawing Entity Relation diagrams is a very time taking and tedious task which usually hampers industrial companies who are designing their databases for the first time. We propose a product that can automatically draw ER diagrams based on the userâ€™s specifications, hence eliminating the need for manually drawing the diagrams.

## Build Status
The project consists of the following components:
- Frontend explaining the interface of the project which has a window for typing the code and an output window displaying the ER diagram. 
- Backend component parsing the code lines using a lexical parser and converting each parsed element into a token.

## Code Style
Code has to be written in go language in the coding window.
## Framework

Frontend:  
- React/NextJs [Javascript based Web framework]
- framer-motion [animation]
- State management system
- Vis.js [graphs]
- Tailwind CSS [styling]
